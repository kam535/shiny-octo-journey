        "description": "In 1830, Catlin accompanied William Clark, of the celebrated Lewis and Clark expedition, up the Mississippi River from St. Louis to Fort Crawford. Before he began more extensive travels in 1832, however, he spent time in eastern cities, where he often saw visiting delegations of Native Americans and was able to paint their portraits. In Washington, D.C., in January and February 1831, Catlin painted Menominee and Seneca delegations, including this portrait of the Ohio Seneca chief Deep Lake. The chief and other members of his tribe were in the capital to negotiate a treaty for the sale of their lands south of Lake Erie. By 1838, the Senecas’ removal from their remaining lands had been set out in the Treaty of Buffalo Creek, and the tribe was to remove to what is known today as Kansas.

        "description": "On this expertly carved comb, two animated figures wearing frock coats—likely a Native American and a Euro-American—face one another. Each has one arm raised in greeting, perhaps marking a diplomatic exchange or treaty. Possibly created by a Seneca artist — the westernmost member of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy — metal and tipped tools were used to form the individual teeth, delicate dot and line borders, and cutout designs. Today, Haudenosaunee artists still produce antler, bone, and other combs featuring animals and human figures.",

The figural design—made using nonlocal materials, including faceted glass beads in a curvilinear applique stitch—represents twin brothers from the origin stories of the Haudenosaunee, the sovereign Native American confederacy of Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca, and Tuscarora Nations. The materials date to the time of the American Revolution, when the confederacy divided its support between the American and British causes. The confederacy’s Grand Council governance system is still active today.",
